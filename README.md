# MITM-file-injection
MITM-injection is a small-sized Python program written to manipulate layer 7 protocols by MITM. Use this program to see how to manipulate HTTP elements when a file is downloaded to spoof the target file to serve an alternate file hosted locally. 

## Getting Started
To run this program, you should already be MITM from your target. You can achieve the MITM by launching an ARP spoof attack on the network. 

## Running the program
Written in python 2.7, make sure to use the appropriate interrupter. Inject whatever file you wish by modifying the appropriate line. The sameple file is hosted on apache web-server on Kali Linux 

## Attention
Please do not use this program where unauthorized.
